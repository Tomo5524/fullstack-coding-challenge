### How to use

You can get this application up and running with just a few steps but the frontend and the backend need to run separately. Follow the steps below to do so.

1. Clone this repo `~$ git clone <SSH URL>`
2. Once you have the repo, you need to install its dependencies. So using a terminal, move into the server directory of the project and execute `yarn` to install the dependencies of the Node.js server. As for client (front-end), navigate to client folder and execute `yarn` to install the dependencies required to run the application
3. Finally, all you have to do is simply run `yarn start` for client and run `yarn dev` for server
